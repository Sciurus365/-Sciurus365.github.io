In Study 1, participants from China recalled the gender composition of their friends at different times, and data from 216 of them aged 17-24 were analyzed. Growth curve models showed that more than half of the friends of heterosexual individuals were same-gender ones and they had an increasingly larger ratio of cross-gender best friends through adolescence, while gay men and lesbians had an increasingly larger ratio of same-gender friends and more than half of them had same-gender best friends. Gay men had a larger ratio of cross-gender friends in primary school than heterosexual men, while lesbians had a larger ratio of same-gender friends at university than heterosexual women. In Study 2, participants from China ranked their preferences for a set of character profiles and reported their gender role, and data from 141 of them aged 16-24 were analyzed. Gay men and lesbians preferred same-gender persons over cross-gender ones. Gender role of the participant had an independent effect on preferences to a character with a given gender role. Findings indicated that sexual orientation has a strong impact on the gender composition of youthsâ€™ friendships, and more attention should be paid to sexual minorities in this field of research.","tags":["friendship","gender role","Sexual orientation","youth/adolescence"],"title":"Gender-Related Friend Preferences of Youths with Different Sexual Orientations: The effects of gender role and sexual attraction","type":"publication"}]
