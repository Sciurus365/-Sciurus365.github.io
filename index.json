These formal models are often used to study psychological states, for example, a healthy state and a psychopathological state. The relative stability of these psychological states is an important avenue for research to better understand individual differences and (clinical) change processes. The potential landscape is often used as a metaphor to conceptually illustrate stability. But recently the corresponding numerical method has been developed, which provides a novel approach to gain quantitative insights into the stability of various states in psychological systems. In this project, we use Wang’s method to quantitatively compute the landscape function for a formal dynamic model of panic disorder. Besides developing a general method, we also aim to examine the stable states of the model based on the landscape function. First results show one stable state – the healthy state – and one quasi-stable state – the panic state. We speculate that the quasi-stable panic state is due to the excitability of the considered model system, which shows longer residence time but not a metastable state. We further found that the stability of the panic state increases as the arousal schema becomes more sensitive. These results are in line with previous clinical findings, providing evidence for the validity of the model. In addition, we also investigated how other model variables and parameter settings influence the relative stability of different psychological states.","tags":null,"title":"From metaphor to computation: Constructing the potential landscape for the dynamics of panic disorder","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1599177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599177600,"objectID":"b5e02625f2a560add567463487a73217","permalink":"https://sciurus365.github.io/talk/multilingual/","publishdate":"2020-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/multilingual/","section":"talk","summary":"As we all have learned from Bill and Bernd, R is a powerful tool for psychological researchers. However, R may not be able to solve every problem you encounter. For example, sometimes there is no suitable package in R, or sometimes R is too slow for your computation. In these cases, maybe you can ask another programming language for help. In this short presentation, I will introduce `reticulate` and `Rcpp` packages which can help to link R with python or cpp. I will also give some example codes and discuss their applicability.","tags":null,"title":"\"Multilingual\" Programming for Psychological Research","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jingmeng Cui","Meng Pei","Yanjie Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"11ce084efbbf2fa3997511841f7cc891","permalink":"https://sciurus365.github.io/publication/cui-gender-related-friend-preferences-2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-25T20:56:47.813304Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cui-gender-related-friend-preferences-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The current research aimed to investigate gender-related preferences of youths with different sexual orientations and examine the effects of gender role and sexual attraction. In Study 1, participants from China recalled the gender composition of their friends at different times, and data from 216 of them aged 17-24 were analyzed. Growth curve models showed that more than half of the friends of heterosexual individuals were same-gender ones and they had an increasingly larger ratio of cross-gender best friends through adolescence, while gay men and lesbians had an increasingly larger ratio of same-gender friends and more than half of them had same-gender best friends. Gay men had a larger ratio of cross-gender friends in primary school than heterosexual men, while lesbians had a larger ratio of same-gender friends at university than heterosexual women. In Study 2, participants from China ranked their preferences for a set of character profiles and reported their gender role, and data from 141 of them aged 16-24 were analyzed. Gay men and lesbians preferred same-gender persons over cross-gender ones. Gender role of the participant had an independent effect on preferences to a character with a given gender role. Findings indicated that sexual orientation has a strong impact on the gender composition of youths’ friendships, and more attention should be paid to sexual minorities in this field of research.","tags":["friendship","gender role","Sexual orientation","youth/adolescence"],"title":"Gender-Related Friend Preferences of Youths with Different Sexual Orientations: The effects of gender role and sexual attraction","type":"publication"}]
